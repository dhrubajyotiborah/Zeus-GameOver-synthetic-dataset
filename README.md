# Zeus-GameOver-synthetic-dataset
The repository contains synthetic Zeus GameOver dataset generated in a testbed. 
This is a compressed file containing the Zeus GameOver botnet traffic flow simulation. A Zeus bot software was created by researching the characteristics of Zeus GameOver from technical reports "ZeuS-P2P monitoring and analysis", published in June 2013 (URL: [https://www.cert.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2013-06-p2p-rap en.pdf), as well as "An analysis of the Zeus peer-to-peer protocol" Technical report, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands, April 2014 (URL:https://syssec.mistakenot.net/papers/zeus-tech-report-2013.pdf).
A testbed has been set up with 101 virtual hosts. Each host has a piece of bot software installed. The bots then communicate with one another. The network traffic was captured for 24 hours. The captured traffic is then used to generate netflow records with the probe tool. The source and destination IP addresses are then extracted from the resulting flow dataset. This flow dataset is created in this manner.
